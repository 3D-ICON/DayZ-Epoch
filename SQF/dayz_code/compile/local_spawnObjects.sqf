/*
	Spawns objects locally for improved performance. 
	- Recommend running on every machine including the server, so all units know about the object.
	- Recommend running early during initialization, so units spawned on top do not fall through.
	- Not recommended for destructible or removable objects. Damage and deleted status are not synced across machines.
	- Not recommended for objects with animations (like gates). Anim status is not synced across machines.
	
	Params:
	[
		["ObjectType1", [position], dir],
		["ObjectType2", [position], dir],
		["ObjectType3", [position], dir]
	] call local_spawnObjects;
